Decimal To Binary Converter
If user inputs an integer greater than what a 32bit can hold, the program gives an overflow error.
If user inputs an integer that's greater magnitude than what a 32bit can hold and is negative, it will also gives an overflow error.
If I write binary-to-decimal converter, I probably do the exact opposite in terms of orders and operations.
